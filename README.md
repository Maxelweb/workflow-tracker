### Requirements

- Apache based web server
- PHP 7.x
- One or more public / private Github repo.


### Installation

> **Tip:** if you download the **source code** from the release page, you can deploy the web app without these files: `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, folders starting with underscore (`_folder`).

1. Download the latest release
2. Change the `res/config.php` and `.htaccess` according to your preferences
3. Insert the files of the downloaded folder in your web space
4. Point the Github Webhook of your repo to `http://your-website.com/res/webhook.php` for only **push** events.
5. Check the first `ping` - `pong` delivery from the Github Webhook page
6. Done :smile:

### Update

> **Tip:** you can check the updates from the updates page link in the navbar

1. Backup locally the `res/data` folder, the `res/config.php` and `.htaccess` files
2. Download the latest release
3. Change the `res/config.php` and `.htaccess` according to your old preferences
4. Replace the `res/data` folder with your local backup
5. Done :grin:

### Stored data

- The data is stored in the `res/data` folder via a single JSON file.
- You will see all the collaborators (after the webhook setup) with at least one push in the repo from any branch.
- The users and the repos won't be automatically deleted.
